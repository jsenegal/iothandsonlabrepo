# Red Hat IoT Demo and Workshop
Based on [redhat-iot/industry-4.0-demo](https://github.com/redhat-iot/industry-4.0-demo)

# Goals
To have a basic web UI that shows realtime data, can search historic data, and activate an IoT demo switch.

# Labs

The labs are numbers and in order for the IoT workshop

```
lab-1-configmap - is the base ConfigMap used for configuring the apps in the other labs
lab-2a-route - a basic camel route that will load data from a CSV file
lab-2a-web - a basic UI that will display the data
lab-2b-route - the camel route gets a little more advanced and pulls data from the EC gateway
lab-3-route - loads data into a database and the UI
lab-4-web - the UI now can search the database for historic events and still pull live events
```

# Branches
```
labs - code needs to be changed to work
master - working solutions
```
